                <h3 id=Introduction>Introduction</h3>
                <p>PredictEd, is a free and open source predictive text editor
                  application, for Microsoft windows.</p>
                <p>It suggests words for auto completion as you start typing. It
                  suggests the next probable words when you finish typing a
                  word, and when you press the space bar, or when you auto
                  complete the word, and press space bar.</p>
                <p>Press the tab key to select a predicted word.</p>
                <p>It presents five such words and three phrases below your
                  cursor. Pressing the tab key again selects the next word or
                  phrase in the list.</p>
                <p>PredictEd learns, as you type in real time, and creates a
                  knowledge base unique to your style of writing, and your
                  subject matter. You get the most relevant suggestions as it
                  builds up its knowledge from the words and phrases you type.
                  Gradually it becomes your personal typing assistant.</p>
                <p>You can also feed it your own writings in the form of text
                  files, and instantly get the same result. PredictEd keeps
                  learning anyway, and builds up the knowledge, as you work.</p>
                  <p>PredictEd can save the entire knowledge in a specific context, subject or language, and can load it back. 
                  This gives you the most suitable suggestions while typing. You can have as many contexts as you wish, each with its
                  own unique and independent database.
                  </p>
                <p>It also has some more smart features like formatting as you
                  type. So that you have a basic formatted document as soon as
                  you finish typing. It also capitalizes the words, inserts
                  spaces after periods and inserts paragraph breaks after new
                  lines. It saves the file after each paragraph automatically.
                  It can save the text as a rich text file with formatting, or
                  as a plain text file. And it can open those formats.</p>
                <p>PredictEd has the usual text editing features such as cut,
                  copy, paste, setting fonts and text sizes, undo and redo, and
                  find and replace functions, and spelling checks. You can also set a default font,
                  text size and text colour, and background colour.</p>
                <p>It supports Unicode text, which means it will work for most
                  of the languages. It learns in a similar way independently of
                  the language and script being used.</p>
                <p>PredictEd is supported on Microsoft Windows 7 to 10.</p>
                <p>To get you quickly started, the installation comes with several built in word lists (knowledge
                  maps), generated using freely available text and books. So it
                  will immediately show suggestions, but it is highly
                  recommended to train it using your own writings, so that you
                  get most relevant suggestions. Anyhow it will learn as you
                  type.</p>
                <p>This tool helps to speed up typing and ease the stress on
                  fingers, especially for those with repetitive stress injury,
                  or carpel tunnel. Initially it will appear as if you have
                  slowed down because now you need to check the suggestions or
                  predictions and decide whether to continue typing or press
                  TAB. But gradually it becomes your habit and the typing will
                  speed up. Takes a bit of practice and getting used to
                  predictive typing.</p>
                <p>The source code of this application is available for anyone
                  to improve, fork, contribute or for use in your own
                  application, without any restrictions.</p>

                <h3 id="Contexts">Contexts</h3>
                <p>A Context is a set of databases related to a particular topic, such as a language or a subject.</p>
                <p>As you use PredictEd, it gathers the words and saves relations between them in knowledge files. There are two such knowledge
                databases and one dictionary associated with the language being used. This information is saved as a Context in the form of a file.</p>
                <p>A Context is useful when you are writing on a particular subject or in a particular language, as you get word suggestions and autocompletion
                suggestions based on exactly that context. For example, if you are writing on the subject of biology, you would prefer words related to 
                that subject, not related to say, business or marketing. When you wish to write on the subject of business, you can simply switch
                to that context. Similarly, for languages.</p>

                <p>So even though the databases sizes are limited due to speed and memory limits, you can have unlimited number of contexts, and hence
                unlimited knowledge data. Using the concept of contexts we can avoid huge databases and irrelevant suggestions. Switching to other languages
                is easy and dynamic. So you can have more than one language in the same document.</p>

                <p>You can load a context from Menu &gt; Contexts &gt; Load Context. Now PredictEd shifts to the subject of this context and language 
                and dictionary of it and begins providing suggestions and autocompletion based on context specific databases.</p>

                <p>PredictEd provides several contexts as place holders with some data to get you started quickly. As you use these contexts
                the context specific data gets updated and the knowledge grows. You can create your own context from Menu &gt; Contexts &gt; Create Context.</p>
                <p>You will get an option to either start from a blank database or copy the current database over to the new context. The currently loaded
                dictionary gets associated with this context.</p>

                <div class="noticebox">
                <p>You can change the current dictionary from Menu &gt; Edit &gt; Check Spelling. Whenever you change the dictionary, the context gets updated.</p>
                <p>You can set which context to load at startup via Settings.</p>
                <p>The current context name is displayed in the status bar below the text area.</p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div class="noticebox">
                <p>It is recommended that the contexts and related files be backed up regularly so that you do not lose the data collected during months or years of using
                PredictEd. Anyhow you can always train it again from your own writings in case of data loss.</p>

                <p>Click Menu &gt; Edit &gt; Spelling Check to check the document for spelling errors. You can specify a dictionary here. Note that some dictionaries have been provided
                with PredictEd but they are small. As you check spelling and add new words into the current dictionary, it grows in size.</p>

                <div class="noticebox">
                <p>You can specify your own dictionary, if you have one. The dictionary format used by PredictEd is very simple, just one word per line. However, the words 
                are pre-sorted by the frequency of use. This makes the searches very fast. Its best to use sorted dictionary, but if you do not have one, an unsorted one will 
                also work, perhaps it will be a bit slow.</p>
                <p>Copy your dictionary into (My) Documents/Oormi Creations/PredictEd 1.x.x/Dictionary folder. The file must be plain text UTF-8.</p>

                <p>Before training ensure that you are in the correct context, as the knowledge files will get over written. (A backup is made anyhow before training.)</p>
                <p>If needed create a new context, and select the option of starting from blank databases when prompted.</p>
                Click the Train button or the Train command from Options menu.
                The Training window appears.<br>

                Click the Add Files button to add some text files. You can use
                Control-Click or Shift-Click to select multiple files. You can
                click the Add button again to add more text files from other
                folders. You can add up to 20 text files for one training
                session.<br>
                <br>
                Click the Start button to start the training. Depending upon the
                file size it can take some time. Close the window when "Finished
                training" message appears.<br>

                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Note: You may see a message saying "List is full. Only
                    relations and weights will be updated". This means that the
                    list has reached a limit of 5000 entries. No new keywords
                    are being added, but predictions and their weights are
                    getting updated.</p>
                  <p>Currently this limit is hard-coded. You can set it to any
                    other value if you compile from the source. Usually a longer
                    list will consume more memory and will be slower.</p>

                It is highly recommended that you feed your own writing as
                training data. PredictEd will learn your style of writing, the
                words you often use and sentences you often write. This will
                help you to type even faster. You will get suggestions in the
                context of your writing.<br>
                <br>
                It is language independent. Text files written in any language
                will work as long as they are in Unicode UTF-8 format.<br>
                You can feed it text files of different languages at once.<br>
                <br>
                The original data will be backed up as soon as you start
                training. In case something goes wrong or you accidentally lose knowledge
                data, you can restore it by simply renaming the backup files. They are in the same folder as knowledge files.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Note: The knowledge data is in plain text CSV format. You
                    can edit or delete the entries in it. Just ensure that you
                    keep the structure intact, else PredictEd may crash or may
                    suggest incorrect words.</p>

                <br>
                
                <b>Erase Knowledge data</b><br>
                <br>
                You can erase the Long term memory by clicking the menu command
                Options &gt; Erase LTM<br>
                This is recommended if you wish to train it from blank. Next
                training will store fresh data in LTM.<br>
                Your old LTM data will be backed up as usual.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Save Knowledge data</b><br>
                <br>
                Usually the knowledge data is saved when you exit PredictEd. But
                you can also do it manually by click on the menu command Options
                &gt; Save Knowledge<br>
                <br>
                This saves both LTM and STM.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Merge LTM and STM</b><br>
                <br>
                Usually when STM (The memory that stores real time learned data)
                is full (5000 entries), it is merged into LTM and is cleared.
                You can do this manually from the menu command Options &gt;
                Merge STM into LTM<br>
                This enables learning of new words as you type.<br>
                <br>
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Note: The number of entries in LTM and STM are shown at the
                    bottom of the editor box. These counters appear when you
                    start typing.</p>

                <h3 id="Encryption">Encryption</h3>
                PredictEd has built in tools to encrypt your files. Try Menu &gt; Encryption.
                <br><br>
                <b>AES Encryption</b><br>
                This is a very strong encryption method with which you can encrypt your files. Any kind of files can be encrypted.
                You can also directly save the typed contents as encrypted files. You can directly load an encrypted file into the editor.<br><br>
                <img src="images/aes.png" alt="aes encryption">
                <br>
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Note: There is a password generation utility in there.<br>Also note that there is no way to recover the password if it is forgotten or lost.</p>
                </div><br>
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Warning: Some countries or corporations may not like it if you send receive encrypted content. This encryption function is directly based on Microsoft's Crypto CNG
                  API and is only as reliable as that. With sufficiently powerful computer and a good motivation, it can be broken. You alone are responsible for using this tool. There are no security 
                  guarantees or any kind of guarantees here.</p>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <b>Base64 Encoding</b><br>
                This is not an encryption but an encoding method in order to transfer files over the internet. It is useful if you wish to upload executable files or email programs or scripts.
                Such files are usually blocked by email providers. Encoding them in Base64 and zipping them before uploading solves the problem.
                <br><br>
                <b>Steganography</b><br>
                This is the famous way to hide data or messages inside images. PredictEd provides its own flavour of Steganography.<br>
                Any files can be embeded into any image. Provided the image is large enough to hold the data. You can optionally use a password protection, which
                XOR encrypts the data before embedding it into the image. The image does change a bit, but is not so obvious, especially if it is a big image.
                <br>You can hide any data into the image and transmit it via email or share online.<br><br>
                <img src="images/steg.png" alt="steg">

                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Note: Currently it accepts only JPG files as input images and the output is always a PNG file.
                  <br>Try using a noisy image with lots of details. Images with smooth areas will turn into noisy images, which looks suspicious.</p>
                </div>
                 <br><br>
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Warning: Always share the passwords for encrypted files via a separate channel. Do not attach them or mention them with the emails etc. Best way is to speak it via phone or in person.</p>
                </div>
                <br><br>
                <b>SHA512 Hash</b><br>
                Its a 512 bit long string of bits which can be used as a signature of the data out of which it was generated. This number can be used to verify the integrity of your files and messages. If 
                the hash of received file does not match with that of original file, the file was modified in some way. The hash can be communicated openly via email etc. An 
                encrypted hash forms a digital signature.
                <br> The best use of SHA512 hash function is to verify the executable files or to detect presence of viruses or malware inside them.
                <br><br>
                <img src="images/sha512.png" alt="oormi">
                <div class="noticebox">
                  <p>Warning: Ensure that the original hash you received is from a trusted source. It is totally possible for someone to change the contents
                  of the file and recalculate the hash with a claim that it is the original hash.</p>
