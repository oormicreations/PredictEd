PredictEd, is a free and open source predictive text editor application, for Microsoft windows.

It suggests words for auto completion as you start typing. It suggests the next probable words when you finish typing a word, and when you press the space bar, or when you auto complete the word, and press space bar.

Press the tab key to select a predicted word.

It presents five such words and three phrases below your cursor. Pressing the tab key again selects the next word or phrase in the list.

PredictEd learns, as you type in real time, and creates a knowledge base unique to your style of writing, and your subject matter. You get the most relevant suggestions as it builds up its knowledge from the words and phrases you type. Gradually it becomes your personal typing assistant.

You can also feed it your own writings in the form of text files, and instantly get the same result. PredictEd keeps learning anyway, and builds up the knowledge, as you work.

PredictEd can save the entire knowledge in a specific context, subject or language, and can load it back. This gives you the most suitable suggestions while typing. You can have as many contexts as you wish, each with its own unique and independent database.

It also has some more smart features like formatting as you type. So that you have a basic formatted document as soon as you finish typing. It also capitalizes the words, inserts spaces after periods and inserts paragraph breaks after new lines. It saves the file after each paragraph automatically. It can save the text as a rich text file with formatting, or as a plain text file. And it can open those formats.

PredictEd has the usual text editing features such as cut, copy, paste, setting fonts and text sizes, undo and redo, and find and replace functions, and spelling checks. You can also set a default font, text size and text colour, and background colour.

It supports Unicode text, which means it will work for most of the languages. It learns in a similar way independently of the language and script being used.

PredictEd is supported on Microsoft Windows 7 to 10.

To get you quickly started, the installation comes with several built in word lists (knowledge maps), generated using freely available text and books. So it will immediately show suggestions, but it is highly recommended to train it using your own writings, so that you get most relevant suggestions. Anyhow it will learn as you type.

This tool helps to speed up typing and ease the stress on fingers, especially for those with repetitive stress injury, or carpel tunnel. Initially it will appear as if you have slowed down because now you need to check the suggestions or predictions and decide whether to continue typing or press TAB. But gradually it becomes your habit and the typing will speed up. Takes a bit of practice and getting used to predictive typing.

The source code of this application is available for anyone to improve, fork, contribute or for use in your own application, without any restrictions.
